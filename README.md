## About Me
I enjoy the challange of turning complex problems into simple and beautiful interface designs. I love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether it be HTML, CSS, or in the future, jQuery. When I am not learning how to code, you'll find me around friends and family or playing simulation video games. Driven and permanently curious, I strive to turn visitors into customers and help your business grow.
