# Romans Webpage


## About Me
The About Me page is the homepage to my website. You can be directed here by clicking 'Roman' or 'Home' buttons in the navigation bar. This page has my self portrait and a section of paragraphs describing my passion for coding.

## Portfolio
The Portfolio page consists of a jumbotron and placeholder images. You can be directed here by clicking the 'Portfolio' button in the navigation bar. I've placed four responsive images that stack on each other as the screen gets smaller.

## Contact Me
Contact Me page has resources for the viewer to have direct contact with me. LinkedIn and GitHub Repository buttons all have their respective colors and go directly to my personal social media accounts. I have also added a field where a potential employer could enter their name, email, and a message to contact me directly from my webpage.
